The following code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error in Firebase when dealing with transactions and concurrent updates:

```javascript
firebase.database().ref('myCounter').transaction(function(currentCount) {
  if (currentCount === null) {
    return 1; // Initialize if the counter doesn't exist
  } else {
    return currentCount + 1; // Increment the counter
  }
});
```

The issue arises when multiple clients concurrently attempt to increment the counter. While the `transaction` method is designed to handle concurrency, there's a subtle edge case: if the initial value is `null`, and multiple clients try to initialize it concurrently, only one will succeed, and the others might fail silently.
